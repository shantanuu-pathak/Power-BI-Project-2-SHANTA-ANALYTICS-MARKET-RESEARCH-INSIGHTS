# SHANTA ANALYTICS MARKET RESEARCH INSIGHTS

## Problem Statement

I'm excited to share an in-depth analysis of retail sales data, conducted using Power BI. This project, completed under my virtual company "Shanta Analytics," leverages a comprehensive dataset provided by Sean Chandler (thank you!).

The report delves into three key areas:

Marketing & Sales Campaign Performance: A high-level overview of campaign effectiveness and key performance indicators.
Buyer Behavior & Segmentation: Deep dive into customer demographics, purchasing habits, and responses to various marketing campaigns.
Purchase Drivers & Influencers: Identifying the factors influencing product purchases and customer engagement with different campaigns using Power BI's Key Influencers feature.
This analysis provides valuable insights for optimizing marketing strategies, enhancing customer engagement, and driving sales growth.


### Steps followed
